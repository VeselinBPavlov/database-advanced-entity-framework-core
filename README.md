We will look in details at working with a modern ORM technology: Entity Framework (EF), which is a ORM standard in C # and .NET applications. EF allows mapping between a relational base and object-oriented model using the "database first" and "code first" approaches and provides a powerful object-oriented API for querying the database and performing CRUD operations. We will demonstrate established practices in building a database layer on sophisticated systems using the "Repository" and "Unit of Work" templates.
